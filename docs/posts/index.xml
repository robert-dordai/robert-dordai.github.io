      <description>Benefits and trade-offs of a tool/approach do not reveal themselves at the same time. Cassandra will instantly be insanely fast, but the features from SQL it had to remove to reach that speed may be understated when starting a system. If troubleshooting seems paranormal, assume the mistake is in your yard. Logic and sound arguments do not gain special properties based on the person using them. Do not introduce random ambiguity, if water is wet just say so, no &amp;ldquo;maybe the water is wet&amp;rdquo;.</description>
